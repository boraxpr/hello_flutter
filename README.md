# my_first_flutter_app

Once upon a time, I let GitHub Copilot (OpenAI) teach me Flutter.
It began with me trying to understand a Flutter code architecture.
Tutorials after tutorials, they only provide code with no deep explanation of what each part does.
I decided to spin up a very basic Flutter app (Flutter Demo) and let Copilot explains to me in the comments.
