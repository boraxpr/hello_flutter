# my_first_flutter_app

Once upon a time, I let GitHub Copilot (OpenAI) teach me Flutter.<br>
It began with me trying to understand a Flutter code architecture.<br>
Tutorials after tutorials, they only provide code with no deep explanation of what each part does.<br>
Following Codelabs ( https://codelabs.developers.google.com/ ),I decided to spin up a very basic Flutter app (Flutter Demo) and let Copilot explains to me in the comments.

I understand about widgets that is each parts of Flutter components is a widget. <br>
There are 2 types of widgets ie. stateless and stateful widgets. <br>
A stateless widget is static and the only way to change them is through manually updates by making use of ChangeNotifier. <br>
In contrast, Stateful widget is dynamic and is the best way to update variables, widgets.
