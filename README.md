Once upon a time, I let GitHub Copilot (OpenAI) teach me Flutter.<br>
It began with me trying to understand a Flutter code architecture.<br>
Tutorials after tutorials, they only provide code with no deep explanation of what each part does.<br>
Following Codelabs ( https://codelabs.developers.google.com/ ),I decided to spin up a very basic Flutter app (Flutter Demo) and let Copilot explains to me in the comments.

## Learn
- I understand about widgets that is each parts of Flutter components is a widget. <br>
There are 2 types of widgets ie. stateless and stateful widgets. <br>
A stateless widget is static and the only way to change them is through manually updates by making use of ChangeNotifier. <br>
In contrast, Stateful widget is dynamic and is the best way to update variables, widgets. <br>
- Nullable, late init variables.
- Commonly used widgets.
- Multiple pages app.
- Responsive app.

## Added Features:
### 1. Camera Preview
### 2. Take a picture

### 3. Detect when there is no camera available (In iOS simulator, there is no camera testing capabilities i.e. availableCamera = 0)
